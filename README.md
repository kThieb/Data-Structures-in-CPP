# Data-Structures-in-CPP
 
This is a library of different data structures implemented in C++ to learn about them.

This project really helped me have a better fundamental understanding of Computer Science.

The currently implemented data structures are:
<ul>
 <li> Queue </li>
 <li> Stack </li>
 <li> Deque </li>
 <li> Max Heap </li>
 <li> Union-find </li>
 <li> Binary Search Tree </li>
 <li> Fenwick Tree in 1D and in 2D </li>
 <li> Trie </li>
 <li> HashMap </li>
</ul>

The following data structures are ones I would like to implement:
<ul>
 <li> Segment Tree (with RMQ, Range Sum, and Lazy Propagation)</li>
 <li> Suffix array </li>
 <li> Lowest Common Ancestor </li>
</ul>
